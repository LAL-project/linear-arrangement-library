 * @brief Uniformly random selection of projective arrangements of a rooted tree.
 *
 * This class does not take into account the symmetries between arrangements
 * produced by swapping leaves of the tree connected to the same parent. That
 * is, the arrangements are select from the can be seen as arrangements of
 * labelled trees. Therefore, this class will select u.a.r. one of the \f$n!\f$
 * arrangements for a star tree of \f$n\f$ vertices.
 *
 * This implements the algorithm in \cite Alemany2022c.
 *
 * See @ref LAL_concepts__linear_arrangement__types for the definition of
 * projective arrangements.
 *
 * An example of usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		// given a rooted tree T
 *		lal::generate::rand_projective_arrgements Gen(T);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * Equivalently,
 * @code
 *		// given a rooted tree T
 *		lal::generate::rand_projective_arrangements Gen(T);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.yield_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
