/**
 * @brief Exhaustive enumeration of arrangements of any graph.
 *
 * This class generates all \f$n!\f$ arrangements of an \f$n\f$-vertex tree.
 * Unlike other generators (e.g. @ref lal::generate::all_projective_arrangements),
 * this class need not be instantiated with a tree but, rather, with a number of
 * vertices due to the simple fact that the tree structure does not matter for
 * the generation of these arrangements. However, constructing this class with
 * a tree (or any graph), is allowed for the sake of consistency.
 *
 * In order to use this class, you must first provide the number of vertices.
 * Arrangements are generated internally, i.e., arragements are encoded in the
 * internal state of the generator. Said state is updated using method @ref next(),
 * which updates it to encode the next arrangement in the generation. In order
 * to retrieve an arrangement, use method @ref get_arrangement(). Upon initialisation,
 * the generator encodes the first arrangement, which has to be retrieved using
 * method @ref get_arrangement().
 *
 * This class can also be instantiated with a graph. Neverthless, only its number
 * of vertices is actually needed.
 *
 * This class is a wrapper over the C++'s std::next_permutation algorithm.
 *
 * A possible usage of this class is the following:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_arrangements Gen(g); // t is any graph (tree included)
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *			Gen.next();
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * When using @ref get_arrangement() in combination with @ref next(), it is important
 * to bear in mind that, if the arrangement is declared as a constant reference,
 * users should <b>not</b> call @ref next() before using the retrieved arrangement.
 * To alleviate this source of bugs, this class can also be used in a for loop:
 * @code
 *		for (lal::generate::all_arrangements Gen(9); not Gen.end(); Gen.next()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * This class also has method @ref yield_arrangement() which is aimed at avoiding
 * potential source of bugs:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_arrangements Gen(8);
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.yield_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * Note that the arrangement is not declared as a constant reference since
 * method @ref yield_arrangement() returns the tree as a copy.
