/**
 * @brief Exhaustive enumeration of planar arrangements of a free tree.
 *
 * The arrangements generated do not take into account the symmetrical
 * arrangements produced by swapping leaves of the tree connected to the
 * same vertex. That is, the arrangements produced can be seen as arrangements
 * of labelled trees. Therefore, this class will generate \f$n!\f$ arrangements
 * for a star tree of \f$n\f$ vertices.
 *
 * In order to use this class, you must first provide the tree object in the
 * constructor. Arrangements are generated internally, i.e., they are encoded in
 * the internal state of the generator. Said state is updated using method
 * @ref next(), which updates it to encode the next arrangement in the generation.
 * In order to retrieve an arrangement, use method @ref get_arrangement(). Upon
 * initialisation, the generator encodes the first arrangement, which has to be
 * retrieved using method @ref get_arrangement().
 *
 * This class implements the algorithm in \cite Alemany2022c.
 *
 * A possible usage of this class is the following:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_planar_arrangements Gen(t); // t is a free tree
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *			Gen.next();
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * Alternatively, this class can be used in a for loop:
 * @code
 *		for (lal::generate::all_planar_arrangements Gen(t); not Gen.end(); Gen.next()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * This class also has method @ref yield_arrangement() which is aimed at
 * simplifying this class' usage:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_planar_arrangements Gen(t); // t is a free tree
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.yield_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
