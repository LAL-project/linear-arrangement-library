/**
 * @brief Exhaustive enumeration of all bipartite arrangements of any bipartite graph.
 *
 * This class generates all \f$|V_1|!\cdot|V_2|!\f$ bipartite arrangements of a
 * bipartite graph \f$B=(V_1\cup V_2, E)\f$ (see page @ref LAL_concepts__linear_arrangement__types
 * for a definition of bipartite arrangements). Unlike other generators
 * (e.g. @ref lal::generate::all_projective_arrangements), this class can be
 * instantiated with the coloring of the bipartite graph, from which the "blue"
 * and "red" vertices are extracted. However, constructing this class with a graph
 * is allowed for the sake of consistency; neverthless, only its number of vertices
 * is actually needed. This is due to the simple fact that the graph structure
 * does not matter for the enumeration of these arrangements.
 *
 * In order to use this class, you must first provide the coloring of the graph.
 * Arrangements are generated internally, i.e., arragements are encoded in the
 * internal state of the generator. Said state is updated using method @ref next(),
 * which updates it to encode the next arrangement in the generation. In order
 * to retrieve an arrangement, use method @ref get_arrangement(). Upon initialisation,
 * the generator encodes the first arrangement, which has to be retrieved using
 * method @ref get_arrangement().
 *
 * This class is a wrapper over the C++'s std::next_permutation algorithm.
 *
 * A possible usage of this class is the following:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_bipartite_arrangements Gen(g); // t is any graph (tree included)
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *			Gen.next();
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * When using @ref get_arrangement() in combination with @ref next(), it is important
 * to bear in mind that, if the arrangement is declared as a constant reference,
 * users should <b>not</b> call @ref next() before using the retrieved arrangement.
 * To alleviate this source of bugs, this class can also be used in a for loop:
 * @code
 *		for (lal::generate::all_bipartite_arrangements Gen(g); not Gen.end(); Gen.next()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * This class also has method @ref yield_arrangement() which is aimed at avoiding
 * potential source of bugs:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_bipartite_arrangements Gen(g);
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.yield_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * Note that the arrangement is not declared as a constant reference since
 * method @ref yield_arrangement() returns the tree as a copy.
 *
 * Furthermore, if the biparite coloring object (@ref lal::properties::bipartite_graph_coloring)
 * of the graph @e g already exists, then one can construct this class using said
 * object.
 * @code
 *		lal::properties::bipartite_graph_coloring c = lal::properties::coloring(g);
 *		lal::generate::all_bipartite_arrangements Gen(c);
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.yield_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
