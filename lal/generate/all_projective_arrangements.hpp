/**
 * @brief Exhaustive enumeration of projective arrangements of a rooted tree.
 *
 * This class does not take into account the symmetries between arrangements
 * produced by swapping leaves of the tree connected to the same parent. That
 * is, the arrangements produced can be seen as arrangements of labelled trees.
 * Therefore, this class will generate \f$n!\f$ arrangements for a star tree of
 * \f$n\f$ vertices.
 *
 * See @ref LAL_concepts__linear_arrangement__types for the definition of
 * projective arrangements.
 *
 * In order to use this class, you must first provide the tree object in the
 * constructor. Arrangements are generated internally, i.e., they are encoded in
 * the internal state of the generator. Said state is updated using method
 * @ref next(), which updates it to encode the next arrangement in the generation.
 * In order to retrieve an arrangement, use method @ref get_arrangement(). Upon
 * initialisation, the generator encodes the first arrangement, which has to be
 * retrieved using method @ref get_arrangement().
 *
 * This class implements the algorithm outlined in \cite Gildea2007a and
 * \cite Futrell2015a.
 *
 * A possible usage of this class is the following:
 * @code
 *		all_projective_arrangements Gen(t); // t is a rooted tree
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *			Gen.next();
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * Alternatively, this class can be used in a for loop:
 * @code
 *		for (all_projective_arrangements Gen(t); not Gen.end(); Gen.next()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement& arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * This class also has method @ref yield_arrangement() which is aimed at simplifying
 * this class' usage:
 * @code
 *		all_projective_arrangements Gen(t); // t is a rooted tree
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement arr = Gen.yield_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
