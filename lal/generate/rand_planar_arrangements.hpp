 * @brief Uniformly random generation of planar arrangements of a labeled rooted tree.
 *
 * A planar arrangement of a directed rooted tree is one in which the
 * root is not covered by any of the tree's edges and there are no edge
 * crossings.
 *
 * An example of usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		// given a rooted tree T
 *		lal::generate::rand_planar_arrgements Gen(T);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement arr = Gen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * Equivalently,
 * @code
 *		// given a rooted tree T
 *		lal::generate::rand_planar_arrangements Gen(T);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *			const linear_arrangement arr = Gen.yield_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
