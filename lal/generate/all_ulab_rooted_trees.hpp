/**
 * @brief Exhaustive enumeration of unlabelled rooted trees.
 *
 * Generates all the unlabelled rooted trees of a given number of nodes. The
 * algorithm implemented can be found in \cite Beyer1980a. The definition of
 * the public and private members of this class follow the notation in this
 * work.
 *
 * In order to use this class, users must provide the size \f$n\f$ of the tree
 * (number of nodes) in the constructor. Trees are generated internally, i.e.,
 * trees are encoded in the internal state of the generator. Said state is
 * updated using method @ref next(), which updates it to encode the next tree in
 * the generation. In order to retrieve the tree, use method @ref get_tree().
 * Upon initialisation, the generator encodes the first tree, which has to be
 * retrieved using method @ref get_tree().
 *
 * All the unlabelled rooted trees will have been generated when method @ref end()
 * returns true. At this point, method @ref get_tree() will always construct the
 * last tree in the enumeration, whichever tree it is. In order to restart the
 * generation of these trees, call method @ref reset(). It is allowed to call
 * this method at any time.
 *
 * A possible usage of this class is the following:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_ulab_rooted_trees Gen(n);
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::graphs::rooted_tree t = Gen.get_tree();
 *			// ...
 *			Gen.next();
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * Alternatively, this class can be used in a for loop:
 * @code
 *		for (lal::generate::all_ulab_rooted_trees Gen(n); not Gen.end(); Gen.next()) {
 *			const lal::graphs::rooted_tree t = Gen.get_tree();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * Equivalently,
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_ulab_rooted_trees Gen(n);
 *		while (not Gen.end()) {
 *			const lal::graphs::rooted_tree t = Gen.yield_tree();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
