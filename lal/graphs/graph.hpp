 * @brief Abstract class for graphs.
 *
 * Class used as an interface for all types of graphs. This means that this
 * class cannot be instantiated. The classes that can be instantiated are
 * @ref undirected_graph, @ref directed_graph, @ref free_tree, @ref rooted_tree.
 *
 * A usual way of initialising classes inheriting from this one is to use one
 * of the @ref init methods available. Depending on the subclass, this method
 * admits either the number of nodes of the graph or a whole other graph and
 * further information (see
 * @ref rooted_tree::init_rooted(const free_tree&,node). While these classes'
 * internal memory can be initialised, it can also be cleared using method
 * @ref clear. Each class reimplements this method to carry this
 * task appropriately.
