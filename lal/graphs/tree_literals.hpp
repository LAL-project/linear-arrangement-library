 * @brief String literal to easily describe free trees.
 *
 * This is meant to be used only on strings that represent:
 * - an edge list, or
 * - a head vector.
 * See the code example for the format of both.
 *
 * Numbers in valid strings are always in base 10. The number of spaces that
 * separate characters can be arbitrarily long or short.

	"{0 1} {0 2} {0 3} {0 4} {0 5} {0 6}"_root_free_tree;
 @endcode
 *
 * @param str A pointer to a C-string encoding the head vector or the edge list.
 * @param s Size of @e str.
 * @returns Returns a std::pair<@ref lal::graphs::free_tree,@ref lal::node>.
 * In case the input string is a head vector the node is the root of the head
 * vector. In case the input is an edge list, the node is invalid, i.e., a value
 * larger than the number of vertices.
 * @post The tree is normalized.
