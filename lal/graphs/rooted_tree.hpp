/**
 * @brief Rooted tree graph class.
 *
 * This class provides its users with an abstraction of rooted trees. Rooted
 * trees are free trees in which one vertex has been designated as the root.
 * Furthermore, in the context of this library, these trees' edges are always
 * oriented towards the leaves (away from the root); this is known as an
 * arborescence. Many methods require objects of this class to be valid rooted
 * trees: the object must be a tree (see @ref is_tree), must have a root (see
 * @ref has_root), and be a valid rooted tree (see @ref is_rooted_tree).
 *
 * Rooted trees can be constructed in two different ways:
 * - Using an already-constructed free tree via a class constructor, where
 * users have to indicate the root (either
 * @ref rooted_tree(const lal::graphs::free_tree&, node, bool, bool)
 * or @ref rooted_tree(lal::graphs::free_tree&&, node, bool, bool)).
 * Alternatively, one can use the method @ref init_rooted, which has the same set
 * of parameters.
 * - Adding edge after edge. In this class, as in @ref lal::graphs::free_tree,
 * this addition is constrained so that the underlying undirected graph does not
 * contain cycles. Before (or after) the addition of all the edges, it is
 * recommended the root be set using @ref set_root.
 *
 * Adding edges one by one has a serious drawback. In case the edges do not
 * have a consistent orientation (either always pointing away from the root
 * or always pointing towards it), the resulting graph is not considered to be
 * a valid rooted tree (see @ref is_rooted_tree). Therefore, consider the use
 * of methods @ref can_add_edge or @ref can_add_edges. Recall that removal of
 * edges is allowed at every moment.
 *
 * The root allows defining further properties on these graphs. For example,
 * the user can query information regarding subtrees of a particular rooted tree
 * (see methods @ref get_num_nodes_subtree, @ref calculate_size_subtrees,
 * @ref get_edges_subtree, and @ref get_subtree). Not every vertex can be a root
 * of the tree: in general, only those vertices with in-degree 0 can
 * (see @ref is_root_valid).
 *
 * This class allows flexibility of use of rooted trees regarding the root's
 * choice (within the valid possibilities). Method @ref set_root allows changing
 * the root of rooted trees multiple times and at any time. However, when the
 * tree has all of its edges then only one vertex can be the root (that with
 * in-degree 0). For this reason, in case a user wants to build "different rooted
 * trees on different roots", it is strongly recommended that first a
 * @ref lal::graphs::free_tree is built, and then create a rooted tree using one
 * of the two constructors with a free tree (either
 * @ref rooted_tree(const lal::graphs::free_tree&, node, bool, bool), or
 * @ref rooted_tree(lal::graphs::free_tree&&, node, bool, bool)), or the method
 * @ref init_rooted.
