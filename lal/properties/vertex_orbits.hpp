 * @brief Construct the set of vertex orbits of a tree.
 *
 * This function implements an algorithm of time complexity \f$O(n^2)\f$, where
 * \f$n\f$ is the number of vertices of the tree. In the future, the linear-time
 * algorithm in \cite Colbourn1981a may be implemented.
 * @param t The input free tree.
 * @returns A vector, each with a list of vertices that belong to the same orbit.
