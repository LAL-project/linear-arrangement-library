 * @brief Branchless paths in trees.
 *
 * A branchless path in a tree is a sequence of vertices of degree two, enclosed
 * by (at most) two vertices of degree different from two. The path graph is a
 * branchless path itself. The legs of a spider graph are all branchless paths,
 * which include the center of the spider.
 *
 * Before adding vertices to this path, it must be initialized via function
 * @ref init.
 *
 * The vertices in each branchless path are of two categories: internal and endpoints.
 * The endpoints of the path are the only two vertices of degree different from
 * two. The internal vertices are the (possibly 0) vertices of degree 2.
