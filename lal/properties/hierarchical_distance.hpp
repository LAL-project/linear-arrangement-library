 * @brief Sum of hierarchical distances (SHD).

 * tree is calculated as the number of edges between these two vertices. Therefore,
 * the hierarchical distance from a root's child and the root is exactly 1.
 *
 * The result of this function is the sum of such distances:
 * \f$SHD = \sum_{u\in V} HD_u\f$.
