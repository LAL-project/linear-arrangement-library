/**
 * @brief A reader for a collection of treebanks.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "collection readers",
 * is an interface to help you do a custom processing of a set of treebanks (see
 * @ref LAL_concepts__treebank_collection and @ref LAL_concepts__treebank for
 * further details on treebanks and treebank collections).
 *
 * The user has to initialise a collection reader with the main file (the main file
 * list). For example, to read the Stanford collection the reader has to be initialised
 * with the main file \a stanford.txt which could contain the contents given
 * above. Bear in mind that a collection reader only processes the main file: it
 * iterates through the list of files within the main file using the method
 * @ref next_treebank. This method can be called as long as method
 * @ref end returns false. Each call to @ref next_treebank builds an
 * object of class @ref treebank_reader which allows the user to iterate
 * through the trees within the corresponding file. This object can be retrieved
 * by calling method @ref get_treebank_reader.
 *
 * An example of usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.
 * @code
 *		lal::io::treebank_collection tbcolreader;
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 *		auto err = tbcolreader.init(mainf)
 *		while (not tbcolreader.end()) {
 *			lal::io::treebank_reader& tbreader = tbcolreader.get_treebank_reader();
 *			if (not tbreader.is_open()) {
 *				tbcolreader.next_treebank();
 *				continue;
 *			}
 *			// here goes your custom processing of the treebank
 *			// ...
 *
 *			tbcolreader.next_treebank();
 *		}
 * @endcode
