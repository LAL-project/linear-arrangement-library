/**
 * @brief A reader for a single treebank file.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "readers", offers
 * a simple interface for iterating over the trees in a single treebank file,
 * henceforth referred to as the treebank (see @ref LAL_concepts__treebank for
 * further details on treebank files).
 *
 * In order to use it, this class has to be first initialized with the treebank
 * file and, optionally, a self-descriptive string, i.e., something that identifies
 * the treebank (e.g., an ISO code of a language). Once initialised, the first
 * tree can be retrievend with @ref get_tree. The other trees can be iterated over
 * by calling @ref next_tree. This function can only be called as long as @ref end
 * returns false.
 *
 * If an object of this class was returned by the class @ref treebank_collection_reader,
 * then methods @ref get_treebank_filename and @ref get_treebank_identifier might
 * prove useful for debugging since they return, respectively, the full name
 * (path included) of the treebank and an identifier string.
 *
 * An example of usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.
 * @code
 *		lal::io::treebank_reader tbread;
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 *		const auto err = tbread.init(main_file);
 *		while (not tbread.end()) {
 *			const lal::graphs::rooted_tree t = tbread.get_tree();
 *			// process tree 't'
 *			// ....
 *			tbread.next_tree();
 *		}
 * @endcode
