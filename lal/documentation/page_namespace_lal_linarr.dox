/**
@brief Namespace for all linear-arrangement-dependent algorithms.

This namespace contains functions to calculate properties of graphs that depend on a linear arrangement. Said arrangement van be given explicitly, i.e., by constructing a @ref lal::linear_arrangement object, or by omitting it in the functions to let these use the labelling of the graph (to read more about the concept of linear arrangement see the @ref LAL_concepts__linear_arrangement page). For example, given a graph

@code
lal::graphs::undirected_graph g;
@endcode

we can calculate the sum of length of the edges using function @ref lal::linarr::sum_edge_lengths in two different ways. The first is by omitting the arrangement:

@code
lal::linarr::sum_edge_lengths(g);
@endcode

or by giving one explicitly

@code
lal::linarr::sum_edge_lengths(g, {...});
@endcode
