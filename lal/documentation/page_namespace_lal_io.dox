@brief Input/Output functions and processing of treebanks.

This namespace contains the functions for input/output operations.

The most basic operations read a graph from a file. The formats supported for reading are:
- Edge list (see @ref LAL_concepts__edge_list page page for details). See @ref lal::io::read_edge_list functions.
- Head vector (see @ref LAL_concepts__head_vector page for details). See @ref lal::io::read_head_vector functions.

Users can also process collection of trees (called treebank files), and collections of treebank files (obviously, a treebank collection). One can process automatically a treebank file (see @ref lal::io::treebank_processor) or a treebank collection (see @ref lal::io::treebank_collection_processor), and iterate through the trees of a treebank file (see @ref lal::io::treebank_reader) and through the treebank files within a treebank collection (see @ref lal::io::treebank_collection_reader).

A treebank file is a file containing only head vectors of trees. Such head vectors may not be formatted correctly (from the standpoint of this library), and so users of the library are also provided with function to check the correctess of such files (see @ref lal::io::check_correctness_treebank and @ref lal::io::check_correctness_treebank_collection). Users are encouraged to read the documentation of these classes to know more about treebank files and collection of treebanks and how to process them with the library.
