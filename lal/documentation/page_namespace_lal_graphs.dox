/**
@brief Namespace for the graphs data structures.
 
This namespace contains the data structures that implement graphs. Note that, although we do not support labelled graphs, the nodes of these graphs carry a label, a number between \f$0\f$ and \f$n-1\f$, where \f$n\f$ is the number of nodes of the graph. The functions (in other namespaces) that return a @ref lal::node will always use a value greater than or equal to \f$n\f$ to denote that the node index is invalid. 

See the concepts in @ref LAL_conectps_graph_theory page of this documentation for further details.
