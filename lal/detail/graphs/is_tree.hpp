 * @brief Is the input graph a tree?
 *
 * By definition, an undirected graph is a tree if it does not contain
 * cycles and has one single connected component. Note that isloated nodes
 * count as single connected components. Directed graphs are allowed.
 * @param g Input graph.
 * @returns True if, and only if, the graph is a tree.
