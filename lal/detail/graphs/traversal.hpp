/**
 * @brief Abstract graph Breadth-First Search traversal.
 *
 * The traversal can be controlled by setting custom control-flow functions:
 * - a function used for early termination of the traversal
 * (see @ref set_terminate),
 * - a function that processes the current node in the traversal
 * (see @ref set_process_current),
 * - a function that processes the current edge in the traversal
 * (see @ref set_process_neighbour),
 * - a function that controls when a node is to be added to the queue of the
 * traversal (see @ref set_node_add).
 *
 * This graph_traversal traversal can also use "reversed edges" when doing traversals on
 * directed graphs. A back edge in a directed graph of a node u is a node
 * that points to u, namely, the directed edge is of the form (v,u), for another
 * node v of the graph. This can be set via the @ref set_use_rev_edges method.
 *
 * An example of usage is as follows:
 @code
 detail::BFS<graphs::undirected_graph> bfs(g); // 'g' is an undirected graph
 bfs.set_terminate( ... ); // assign a function to decide when to terminate the search.
 bfs.set_process_neighbour( ... ); // assign a function to process neighbours
 bfs.start_at(0); // start the traversal now at node 0.
 @endcode
 *
 * @tparam graph_t Type of graph.
