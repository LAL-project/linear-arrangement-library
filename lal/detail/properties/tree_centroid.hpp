 * @brief Retrieves the centroid of the tree
 *
 * While looking for the centroid, this function updates @e L and @e sizes_edge.
 *
 * This function uses @ref lal::detail::calculate_bidirectional_sizes, an
 * algorithm described in \cite Hochberg2003a (see function's documentation for
 * details).
 *
 * @tparam tree_t The type of tree.
 * @param t Input tree.
 * @param N Actual number of vertices of the tree
 * @param n Number of vertices of the connected component of node @e x.
 * @param x Starting node. Node of the component whose centroid we want.
 * @param[out] L Adjacency list-like data structure. \f$L[u]\f$ is a list of
 * pairs \f$(v, n_u(v))\f$ where \f$v\f$ is a neighbour of \f$u\f$ and
 * \f$n_u(v)=|V(T^u_v)|\f$ is the size of the subtree \f$T^u_v\f$ in vertices.
 * @param[out] sizes_edge Auxiliary memory to construct @e L. For every edge
 * \f$\{u,v\}\f$ contains two pairs \f$((u,v), s)\f$ and \f$((v,u), n-s)\f$,
 * where \f$n\f$ is the number of vertices of the connected component of 'x'
 * and \f$s=|V(T^u_v)|\f$.
 * @returns A tuple of two values: the nodes in the centroid. If the
 * tree has a single centroidal node, only the first node is valid and the second
 * is assigned an invalid vertex index. It is guaranteed that the first vertex
 * has smaller index value than the second.
 * @post @e L is updated. It is sorted decreasingly.
 * @post @e sizes_edge is updated.
