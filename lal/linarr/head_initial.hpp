/**
 * @brief Computes the headedness of a directed graph as an exact rational number.
 *
 * Given a graph and a permutation of its nodes, the headedness \f$h\f$
 * is the ratio of right-branching edges over the total amount of edges. More
 * precisely, it is
 *
 * \f$h = \frac{r}{m}\f$
 *
 * where \f$r\f$ is the number of right-branching edges and \f$m\f$ is the number
 * of edges of the graph.
 *
 * A value of 0 indicates perfect left branching, and a value of 1 indicates
 * perfect right-branching. See \cite Liu2010a for further detals.
 * @param g Input graph.
 * @param pi Permutation of the nodes. When omitted, \f$\pi_I\f$ is used.
 * @returns The headedness ratio as an exact rational number.
 * @pre \f$m > 0\f$.
