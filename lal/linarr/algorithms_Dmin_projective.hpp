 * @brief The different algorithms for computing the minimum sum of the

 * Recall that a projective arrangement is one in which there are no edge
 * crossings and the root is not covered by any edge.
 *
 * This enumeration's values are used to choose the algorithm which the functions
 * @ref lal::linarr::min_sum_edge_lengths_projective use to compute the minimum
 * value of the sum of the length of the edges \f$D\f$.
