NAMING OF CLASSES AND FUNCTIONS
===============================

- We allow the following shorthands

	SHORTHAND			MEANING

	'rand'				random
	'min'				minimum
	'max'				maximum
	'exp'				expected (as in expected value of a random variable)
	'var'				variance (as in variance of a random variable)

We favor the shorthands in the left column over those in the right column

	'mean'				'avg'

- Classes that should not be used by users start with an underscore '_'

- We use snake case

- The name of the function should be self-explanatory.

DOCUMENTATION FORMAT GUIDELINES
===============================

* Minimise references to other methods, like 'see @ref ...', since python users can't do that... Therefore, be redundant when documenting.

* The format of a doxygen string: ( the string '//!' here denotes a comment explaining something about the format and must NOT be included in the actual documentation)

	/**
	 * @brief A brief description.
	 * //! we DO need a blank space here
	 * A more detailed description.
	 * //! There is no need for a blank space here
	 * @param parameter_1 Description of parameter 1
	 * @param parameter_2 Description of parameter 2
	 * @param parameter_3 Description of parameter 3
	 * ...
	 * @returns A value...
	 * @pre Precondition 1
	 * @pre Precondition 2
	 * @pre Precondition 3
	 * ...
	 * @post Postcondition 1
	 * @post Postcondition 2
	 * @post Postcondition 3
	 * ...
	 */

* LaTeX-ed mathematical expressions must not contain spaces right after the first '\f$' and right before the last '\f$'. For example, these

		\f$  \forall u,v\f$
		\f$  \forall u,v  \f$
		\f$\forall u,v  \f$
		
	are malformed mathematical expressions. The correct way of writing them is by removing the spaces around the '\f$', like this:
	
		\f$\forall u,v\f$
		
	NOTE: we need this to ensure that math symbols will be displayed correctly in Spyder

* When referencing methods, classes or enumerations (or whatever) of the library outside the scope of the current documentation block, do so with the full paths. Like this

		see @ref lal::graphs::free_tree
		see @ref lal::linarr::Dmin
	
	and never like this
	
		see @ref graphs::free_tree
		see @ref free_tree
		see @ref linarr::Dmin
		see @ref Dmin
	
	The scope of the documentation block refers to the class/method or class member the documentation block documents. For example:
	
		/**
		 * @brief This is a documentation block whose scope is that of a class.
		 *
		 * See method @ref method().
		 */
		class free_tree {
		public:
			/**
			 * @brief This is a documentation block whose scope is that of the 'method' member of class 'free_tree'.
			 */
			void method() { .. }
			...
		}
	
	When referencing members of a class, say 'free_tree', within a documentation block whose scope is that of the class it documents, full paths are not necessary. It should be understood, by context, what method that "see @ref ..." refers to.
	
		/**
		 * @brief This is a documentation block whose scope is that of a class.
		 *
		 * See methods @ref method1() and @ref method2().
		 */
		class free_tree {
		public:
			/**
			 * @brief This is a documentation block whose scope is that of the 'method' member of class 'my_class'.
			 *
			 * See @ref method2.
			 */
			void method1() { .. }
			
			/**
			 * @brief This is a documentation block whose scope is that of the 'method' member of class 'my_class'.
			 *
			 * See @ref method1.
			 */
			void method2() { .. }
		}
