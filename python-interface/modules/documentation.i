`__rand_lab_free_trees(n, seed=0)`  
`__rand_lab_free_trees(Gen)`  

Random labelled free tree generator.  

**Users should refrain from using this class.** The generation of random
labelled trees should be done using the wrapper class rand_lab_free_trees. This
class, however, contains the actual code to generate labelled free trees
uniformly at random.  

This class implements an algorithm that uses uniformly random Prüfer sequences
(see [22]). The construction of the free labelled tree uses the algorithm in
[4].  

Constructors

`__rand_lab_rooted_trees(Gen)`  

Random labelled directed rooted trees generator.  

**Users should refrain from using this class.** The generation of random
labelled trees should be done using the wrapper class rand_lab_rooted_trees.
This class, however, contains the actual code to generate labelled rooted trees
uniformly at random.  

These trees are generated by first generating uniformly at random a free
labelled tree. Then, a node of the generated tree is chosen uniformly at random.
This node plays the role of the root of the rooted labelled tree. The edges are
oriented away from the root.

**Users should refrain from using this class.** The generation of random

procedure (see [20], chapter 29) and runs in about the same time. The
implementation of Wilf's paper (see [27]) in functions get_tree, forest, and

%feature("docstring") lal::generate::__rand_ulab_rooted_trees::clear "

Clears the memory occupied.  

In order to save computation time, this class has been designed to reuse memory
when generating trees. For example, since it needs the values of well-known
integer sequences (see attribute m_rn) that are costly to compute every time
they are needed, they are stored in memory and reused over time.  

So, if the user wants to generate trees of 1000 nodes there will be too much
memory occupied (and unused) if then this class is used to generate trees of 10
nodes. In cases like this it is recommended to clear the memory occupied.  

post: After calling this method, the contents of the attributes m_rn are
    cleared. Attribute m_rn is then assigned the same 31 values that it is
    assigned when creating an object of this class.

`all_lab_free_trees(Gen)`  

Exhaustive labelled free tree generator.  

Generates all the labelled free trees of a given number of nodes. The algorithm
implemented uses Prüfer sequences (see [22]) and decodes them using the
algorithm in [4].  

In order to use this class, you must first provide the size :math:`n` of the tree
(number of nodes) in the constructor or in the init method of the trees to be
generated.  

Then, call method next to modify the internal state that will allow the user to
construct the tree by calling method get_tree.  

All the free labelled trees have been generated when method has_next returns
false. At this point, method get_tree will always construct a star tree of :math:`n` nodes.  

In order to restart the generation of these trees, call method init again. It is
allowed, at any time, to call init with the same size of the trees, or with a
different one.

`directed_graph()`  
`directed_graph(n)`  
`directed_graph(g)`  

Directed graph class.  

Class implementing a directed graph, using the adjacency list data structure.  

An object of this class must be initialised either with its constructor or with
the init(uint32_t) method. Edges can then be added one by one (see
add_edge(node,node,bool,bool) ) or all at the same time (see add_edges(const
std::vector<edge>&, bool,bool) ).

Iterator over the set of edges.  

This class is used to easily iterate over the edges of a graph.  

This class iterates over the edges of a graph. For undirected graphs, the edge
returned is an edge :math:`(u,v)` so that the inequality :math:`u < v` always holds. For
directed graphs, this is not always true since the edge returned always has
left-to-right orientation.

%feature("docstring") lal::graphs::free_tree::set_edges "

Adds a list of edges to the graph.  

This list of edges is assumed to be all the edges that are going to be added to
this graph. This means that the internal data structures are constructed more
efficiently than when adding edges one by one (see add_edge) or in several
chunks (see add_edges). For a more controlled addition of the edges, see
can_add_edges.  

Moreover, the current structure of the graph is cleared before setting the new
edges.  

Parameters
----------
* `edges` :  
    The edges to be added.  
* `norm` :  
    Normalise the graph after the insertions.  
* `check_norm` :  
    If *norm* is false then, should we check whether the result is normalised or
    not? This might be useful in case the resulting graph is normalised. If
    *norm* is true then *check_norm* is ignored.  

pre: There are no repeated edges in the list.  

pre: The graph is empty prior to the addition.  

post: If *norm* is true the graph is guaranteed to be normalised after the
    addition of the edge.

    the current tree.  

    Parameters:
  
    * `t` :

`graph()`  
`graph(n)`  
`graph(g)`  

Abstract class for graphs.  

Class used as an interface for all types of graphs. This means that this class
cannot be instantiated. The classes that can be instantiated are
undirected_graph, directed_graph, free_tree, rooted_tree.  

A usual way of initialising classes inheriting from this one is to use one of
the init methods available. Depending on the subclass, this method admits either
the number of nodes of the graph or a whole other graph and further information
(see rooted_tree::init_rooted(const free_tree&,node). While these classes'
internal memory can be initialised, it can also be cleared using method clear.
Each class reimplements this method to carry this task appropriately.

`rooted_tree()`  
`rooted_tree(n)`  
`rooted_tree(r)`  
`rooted_tree(t, r)`  

Rooted tree graph class.  

This class provides its users with an abstraction of rooted trees. Rooted trees
are free trees in which one vertex has been designated as the root. Furthermore,
in the context of this library, these trees' edges are always oriented towards
the leaves (away from the root); this is known as an arborescence. Many methods
require objects of this class to be valid rooted trees: the object must be a
tree (see is_tree), must have a root (see has_root), and be a valid rooted tree
(be an arborescence, that is, see is_orientation_valid).  

Rooted trees can be constructed in two different ways:  

*   Using an already-constructed free tree via a class constructor, where users
    have to indicate the root (see rooted_tree(const free_tree&, node)).
    Alternatively, one can use the method init_rooted, which has the same set of
    parameters.  
*   Adding edge after edge. In this class, as in free_tree, this addition is
    constrained so that the underlying undirected graph does not contain cycles.
    Before (or after) the addition of all the edges, it is recommended the root
    be set using set_root. If the edges have been added in a systematic fashion
    -- so it is known whether the tree is an arborescence or not --, it is
    recommended that the validity of the edges' orientation be set by the user
    via method set_valid_orientation. If it is not known (or it can't be
    guaranteed) that the resulting tree is an arborescence, use method
    find_edge_orientation.  

Adding edges one by one has a serious drawback. In case the edges do not have a
consistent orientation (either always pointing away from the root or always
pointing towards it), the resulting graph is not considered to be a valid rooted
tree (see is_rooted_tree). Due to efficiency reasons, orientation of edges is
not checked before or after their addition. Recall that removal of edges is
allowed at every moment.  

The root allows defining further properties on these graphs. For example, the
user can query information regarding subtrees of a particular rooted tree (see
methods n_nodes_subtree, calculate_size_subtrees, get_edges_subtree, and
get_subtree).  

This class allows flexibility of use of rooted trees regarding the root's
choice. Method set_root allows changing the root of rooted trees multiple times
and at any time. However, any information dependent on the root becomes invalid
upon any change of the root. This information includes, and may not be limited
to, the type of rooted tree and the size of the subtrees (see n_nodes_subtree).
For this reason, is is strongly recommended to build a free tree first and use
the constructor rooted_tree(const free_tree&, node), or the method init_rooted,
in order to build rooted trees.

%feature("docstring") lal::graphs::rooted_tree::set_edges "

Adds a list of edges to the graph.  

This list of edges is assumed to be all the edges that are going to be added to

Overloaded function
-------------------
* `disjoint_union(t, connect_roots=true)`  
    
    Disjoint union of trees.  

    Append a rooted tree to this tree. All the nodes in *t* are relabelled
    starting at *n*, the number of nodes of the current tree. If the current
    graph has no vertices, then the contents of *t* are simply copied into this
    graph.  

    Parameters:
  
    * `t` :  
        Input tree.  
    * `connect_roots` :  
        The root of the current tree and the root of *t* are joined by an edge.  

    pre: If *connect_roots* is true then both trees need to have a root (see
        method has_root).  

    post: The root (if set) of the current tree is kept.  

    post: Copying the edges of *t* into this tree retains their original
        orientation.  

    post: The size of the subtrees might need recalculating:  

        *   If method size_subtrees_valid() returns true for both trees then the
            subtree sizes are updated and do not need to be recalculated and
            method size_subtrees_valid() still returns true.  
        *   If for one of the tw graphs method size_subtrees_valid() returns
            false then it will still return false after this operation.

%feature("docstring") lal::graphs::rooted_tree::find_edge_orientation "

Finds the orientation of the edges.  

It is mandatory that this tree be an arborescence. Therefore, when the tree has
been built by adding edges (see add_edge, add_edges), the user must tell this
class whether what has been built is an arborescence or not. One can do this by
calling method find_edge_orientation or by setting the type directly using
method set_valid_orientation.  

This method examines the orientation of the tree's edges with respect to the
root and to the leaves, i.e., it determines whether all edges are oriented
towards the leaves (away from the root).  

Returns
-------
True if the tree is an arborescence. Returns false otherwise.  

pre: This object is a tree (see is_tree).  

pre: This tree has a root (see has_root).  

post: Method is_orientation_valid evaluates to true if the tree is an

be calculated prior to calling many functions of this library.  

Returns
-------

";

%feature("docstring") lal::graphs::rooted_tree::get_edges_subtree "

Retrieve the edges of the subtree rooted at *u*.  

The list of edges returned contains labels that depend on the parameter *relab*.
If *relab* is true then the nodes are relabelled to numbers in :math:`[0, n_u)`  where
:math:`n_u` is the number of nodes of the subtree rooted at *u*, rather than keeping
the original labelling of numbers in :math:`[0,n)`  where *n* is the number of nodes
of the tree.  

In case of directed trees, the subtree is extracted regardless of the
orientation of the edges. For example, consider the following complete binary
tree of 7 nodes, whose edges are
0 -> 1 -> 3
       -> 4
  -> 2 -> 5
       -> 6
 The edges of the subtree rooted at 1 are \"1 -> 3\" and \"1 -> 4\". Moreover,
the orientation of the edges in the new tree is kept.  

This method can be seen as a way of relabelling nodes when *u* is the root of
the tree and *relab* is true.  

Parameters
----------
* `u` :  
    Root node of the subtree.  
* `relab` :

`tree()`

Tree graph class.  

This is an abstract class for those tree-like graphs. Classes that implement
different abstractions of trees and that inherit from this class are: free_tree,

In these classes the addition of edges is constrained so as to ensure that the
edges added actually yield trees, i.e., that cycles are never produced. For the
sake of efficiency, only debug compilations of the library (compilations where
the DEBUG symbol is defined) check that such additions do not produce cycles. In
case of doubt, one can query the class using methods can_add_edge or
can_add_edges prior to adding one or several edges.

Treebank dataset processor.  

This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the \"processors\", has
the goal to ease the processing a whole treebank dataset and produce data for a
fixed set of features. This is most useful when the features to be calculated
are only those available in the library. See the enumeration tree_feature for
details on the features available. Since not all features available have to be
computed, this class offers the possibility to compute only a subset of them.
Each feature can be set to be calculated via method add_feature.  

A treebank dataset is made up of a set of files, each containing several
syntactic dependency trees of sentences. Each file is referred to as a treebank
file. Each of these files is referenced within a \"main file list\", henceforth
called the \"main file\". The main file is a two-column formatted file, the
first of which contains a self-descriptive name of the treebank that is
indicated in the next column.  

For example, the main file of a treebank dataset of languages could contain:  

    arb path/to/file/ar-all.heads2
    eus path/to/file/eu-all.heads2
    ben path/to/file/bn-all.heads2
    ...
 where the first column contains a string referencing the treebank of a language
(in this case, by giving an ISO code of a language), and the second column
contains the full path to the file with the syntactic dependency trees.  

Every processor must be initialised prior to processing the files. This is done
via method init, which requires the path to the main file and the output
directory where the results are going to be stored. Besides these, it also
requires a Boolean value indicating whether all (or none) of the features should
be used. Moreover, it also admits an optional parameter indicating the number of
threads to be used to parallelise the processing of the files. Finally, the
treebank dataset is processed via method process which returns a value of the
enumeration processor_error. Further errors can be checked via methods
get_num_processor_errors, get_error_type, get_error_treebank_filename,
get_error_treebank_name.  

The usage of this class is a lot simpler than that of class
treebank_dataset_reader. See code for details.

// File: classlal_1_1io_1_1treebank__dataset__reader.xml


%feature("docstring") lal::io::treebank_dataset_reader "

A reader for a dataset of treebank files.  

This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the \"dataset readers\",
is an interface to help you do a custom processing of a set of treebanks. A
treebank dataset is a set of files, each of which is a treebank. A treebank is a
file containing one or more lines, each describing a syntactic dependency tree.
If you want to output any of the features already calculated by the library, use
class treebank_dataset_processor instead; said class is much easier to use and
can process treebanks in parallel.  

Each tree in a treebank file is formatted as a list of whole positive numbers
(including zero), each representing a node of the tree. The number 0 denotes the
root of the tree, and a number at a certain position indicates its parent node.
For example, when number 4 is at position 9 it means that node 9 has parent node
4. Therefore, if number 0 is at position 1 it means that node 1 is the root of
the tree. A complete example of such a tree's representation is the following  

      0 3 4 1 6 3
 which should be interpreted as  

    predecessor:       0 3 4 1 6 3
    node of the tree:  1 2 3 4 5 6
 Note that lines like these are not valid:  

    (1) 0 2 2 2 2 2
    (2) 2 0 0
 Line (1) is not valid due to a self-reference in the second position, and (2)
not being valid due to containing two '0' (i.e., two roots).  

A treebank dataset reader helps you navigate through a treebank dataset. It does
the job of initialising the treebank_reader class, which is what you need to do
a custom process of a treebank file.  

Now, the treebank files are referenced within a \"main file list\", henceforth
called the main file. The main file's lines contain only two strings describing
a treebank. The first string is a self-descriptive name of the treebank (e.g.,
the ISO code of a language), and the second is the relative path to the file
containing the syntactic dependency trees (e.g., the syntactic dependency trees
of a language in a dataset). The path is relative to the directory that contains
the main file.  

For example, the main file could be called *stanford.txt*, representing the
Stanford dataset, and could contain:  

    arb path/to/file/ar-all.heads2
    eus path/to/file/eu-all.heads2
    ben path/to/file/bn-all.heads2
    ...
 where the first column contains a string referencing the language (in this
case, an ISO code), and the second column contains the relative path to the file
with the syntactic dependency trees.  

The user has to initialise a dataset reader with the main file (the main file
list). For example, to read the Stanford dataset the reader has to be
initialised with the main file *stanford.txt* which could contain the contents
given above. Bear in mind that a dataset reader only processes the main file: it
iterates through the list of files within the main file using the method
next_treebank. This method can be called as long as method has_treebank returns
true. Each call to next_treebank builds an object of class treebank_reader which
allows the user to iterate through the trees within the corresponding file. This
object can be retrieved by calling method get_treebank_reader.  

The correct usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.  

C++ includes: treebank_dataset_reader.hpp
";

%feature("docstring") lal::io::treebank_dataset_reader::init "

Initialise the reader with a new dataset.  

Parameters
----------
* `main_file` :

";

";

";

// File: classlal_1_1io_1_1treebank__reader.xml


%feature("docstring") lal::io::treebank_reader "

A reader for a single treebank file.  

This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the \"readers\", offers
a simple interface for iterating over the trees in a single treebank file,
henceforth referred to as the treebank. Each tree is formatted as a list of
whole, positive numbers (including zero), each representing a node of the tree.
The number 0 denotes the root of the tree, and a number at a certain position
indicates its parent node. For example, when number 4 is at position 9 it means
that node 9 has parent node 4. Therefore, if number 0 is at position 1 it means
that node 1 is the root of the tree. A complete example of such a tree's
representation is the following  

      0 3 4 1 6 3
 which should be interpreted as  

    predecessor:       0 3 4 1 6 3
    node of the tree:  1 2 3 4 5 6
 Note that lines like these are not valid:  

    (1) 0 2 2 2 2 2
    (2) 2 0 0
 Line (1) is not valid due to a self-reference in the second position, and (2)
not being valid due to containing two '0' (i.e., two roots).  

In order to use it, this class has to be first initialized with the treebank
file and, optionally, a self-descriptive string, i.e., something that identifies
the treebank (e.g., an ISO code of a language). Once initialised, the user can
iterate over the trees within the file by calling next_tree. This function can
only be called as long as has_tree returns true. Retrieving the trees is done by
calling the function get_tree.  

If an object of this class was returned by the class treebank_dataset_reader,
then methods get_treebank_filename and get_identifier might prove useful for
debugging since they return, respectively, the full name (path included) of the
treebank and the language it corresponds to.  

The correct usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.  

C++ includes: treebank_reader.hpp

%feature("docstring") lal::graphs::undirected_graph::add_edge "

Adds an edge to the graph.  

For developers: method graph::extra_work_per_edge_add is called after the edge
has been added.

This method only adds an edge, and does no other work: normalisation is not
checked, and no extra work per edge is done.  

Parameters

    Valid node index: :math:`0 \\le s < n`   
* `t` :  
    Valid node index: :math:`0 \\le t < n`

    Check wether the graph is normalised or not.  
";

%feature("docstring") lal::graphs::undirected_graph::add_edges "

Adds a list of edges to the graph.  

This operation is faster than calling add_edge(node,node,bool,bool) since the
edges are added in bulk.  

For developers: method graph::extra_work_per_edge_add is called for every edge
added.  

Parameters
----------
* `edges` :  
    The edges to be added.  
* `norm` :  
    Normalise the graph after the insertions.

chunks (see add_edges).  

Moreover, the current structure of the graph is cleared before setting the new
edges.  

Parameters

%feature("docstring") lal::graphs::undirected_graph::remove_edges "

Remove an edge from this graph.  

This operation is faster than removing edges one by one with
remove_edge(node,node,bool,bool) since the edges are removed in bulk.  

For developers: method graph::extra_work_per_edge_remove is called after each
edge has been removed.  

Parameters
